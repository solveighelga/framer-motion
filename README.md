# Framer-motion. project

My project is a guide for our workshop. 

If you have opned up my project you will see that none of the cards have information on them yet (except one test card in Toggle). There is a reason for that and that is I would like to get **feedbck on what information would be useful** to you on the card vs. inside the code in sandbox (comments in code). I tried to put a code snippet on the card but was unsuccessful :( Would you like to see an image of the code on the card that you will be using? or is that maybe unnecessary?

## Presentation

What information would you find useful in the presentation to be able to take part in the workshop? I will start off my introducing Framer Motion and then go into micro animations specifically before introducing the workshop where you will be testing framer-motion with a toggle switch, button effects, drag, path and scroll (hopefully)!

### Are three examples per animation enough (cards)?

Should I write the whole code out in Sandbox for you and then all you have to do is play around with the numbers? or should I have you write the code snippet by hand? I am leaning towards writing the code for you and you play around with numbers and small animations I think if you write the code yourself it will take too long. Thoughts?

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
